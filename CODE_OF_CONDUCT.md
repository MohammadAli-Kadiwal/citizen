# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers agree to make participation in the `Citizen` project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sexual and gender identity, orientation and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, geographical location.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, documentation edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
