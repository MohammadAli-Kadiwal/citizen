## Study for the American citizenship test

Citizen is a clean, light weight mobile app, to help study for [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/)'s civic test. The civic test is part of the naturalization interview every applicant has to take.

Want to read more about the naturzalization process? Read more on [what to expect](https://my.uscis.gov/citizenship/what_to_expect).

On the day of your test, the USCIS officer will ask you 10 out of [100 possible questions](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/study-test/study-materials-civics-test). Make sure you are ready, by practicing with the [Citizen app](https://expo.io/@eseite47/citizen).

To use the citizen app, visit [the app's expo page](https://expo.io/@eseite47/citizen).

We hope to make the app available for download on the Google Play Store soon.

Once you have the app open, select a question category and navigate through the flash cards with the arrow button at the bottom of the screen. For each question, you can access the answer by taping the question.
